## 🎯 CHALLENGE ME SECTION

### Section Header
- **Title**: "Challenge Me"
- **Subtitle**: "Test my system design thinking with real-world scenarios"

### Challenge 1: Real-Time Order Processing
**Question**: "Design a real-time order processing system for an e-commerce platform handling 10K orders/day"

**Options**:
- A: "Batch processing every hour with SQL queries" (Incorrect: "Batching works for low-volume but won't achieve real-time freshness for 10K orders/day")
- B: "Kafka + Spark Streaming + Snowflake with medallion architecture" (Correct: "✓ Correct! This is exactly what I built. Kafka ingests events, Spark processes in micro-batches, and Snowflake stores in Bronze/Silver/Gold layers for analytics")
- C: "Direct writes to data warehouse from application" (Incorrect: "Direct writes create tight coupling and won't scale with high throughput")

### Challenge 2: Snowflake Cost Optimization
**Question**: "You need to support 200+ users querying a Snowflake warehouse. How do you optimize costs?"

**Options**:
- A: "Give everyone access to X-Large warehouse" (Incorrect: "Over-provisioning warehouses leads to unnecessary costs")
- B: "Create aggregated views + clustering keys + query result caching + separate warehouses by workload" (Correct: "✓ Exactly my approach! Pre-aggregate common queries, use clustering for large tables, enable result caching, and separate analytical vs operational workloads")
- C: "Restrict user access to reduce queries" (Incorrect: "Limiting access defeats the purpose of democratizing data")

### Challenge 3: Data Quality in Multi-Source ETL
**Question**: "How would you ensure data quality in a multi-source ETL pipeline?"

**Options**:
- A: "Manual spot checks once a week" (Incorrect: "Manual checks don't scale and miss issues in real-time")
- B: "Automated dbt tests + Great Expectations + schema validation + SLA monitoring with alerts" (Correct: "✓ This is the way! Automate schema checks, uniqueness tests, freshness SLAs, and alerting for anomalies. Prevention > detection")
- C: "Trust the source systems" (Incorrect: "Source systems change unexpectedly. Always validate at ingestion")
